usage of Django 4.0.4.
It is based on the already developed DAN model / link to respository: https://github.com/yaoing/DAN.

Currently FER working only for the images has been implemented. 
Pre-trained affecnet8_epoch5_acc0.6209.pth model needs to be downloaded and put into \ferapp\ml_model\image_mode\checkpoints folder.
